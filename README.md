This repository includes all the MATLAB scripts used in our work: Robust fMRI Time-Varying Functional Connectivity Analysis Using Multivariate Swarm Decomposition.

To replicate the results of our simulations, one can directly use the scripts simulation1.m and simulation1_eval.m (modify for the rest of simulations accordingly). For the parameter sensitivity analysis, one can use the scripts PSA_simulation1.m
